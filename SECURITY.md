# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Commitment to Security

At GenXstrom, I am committed to ensuring the security of all my projects. This document outlines the procedures for reporting vulnerabilities and details my approach to addressing security concerns.

## 🔍 Supported Versions

Below is a list of project versions that are currently receiving security updates. If you're using an unsupported version, please update to a supported version before reporting security issues.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.2.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.0.x   | :x:                |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## 🐛 Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### Step 1: Initial Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please send an email to [security@genxstrom.dev](mailto:GenXstrom.security@gmaail.com) with the following information:
- Clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggested fixes (if available)

### Step 2: Acknowledgment

You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours. Your report will be assigned a unique identifier for tracking purposes.

### Step 3: Assessment & Resolution

I will investigate all reports and work to:
- Confirm the vulnerability
- Assess its severity and impact
- Develop and test a fix
- Implement the fix in all supported versions

### Step 4: Disclosure

Once the vulnerability has been addressed:
- You will be notified of the resolution
- A security advisory will be published
- Proper credit will be given to you for responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## ⏱️ Expected Timeframes

| Action | Timeframe |
| ------ | --------- |
| Initial Acknowledgment | Within 48 hours |
| Status Update | Every 3-5 days |
| Vulnerability Assessment | Within 1 week |
| Security Fix Implementation | Depends on complexity (typically 1-4 weeks) |

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

When contributing to this project, please adhere to these security best practices:

1. **Never** commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, credentials)
2. **Always** validate input data
3. **Regularly** update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities
4. **Follow** the principle of least privilege in code design
5. **Implement** appropriate error handling to avoid information leakage

## 📜 Disclosure Policy

I believe in responsible disclosure and follow these principles:

- Reporters of vulnerabilities will be acknowledged (with permission)
- Public disclosure will only occur after a fix is available
- Security advisories will provide adequate information without revealing exploit details
