## 💭 Cyber Security Wisdom

> "In the world of cyber security, paranoia is a healthy mindset. Always prepare for unseen attacks, and never assume your systems are completely secure."

> "The journey in the cyber security world begins with small but consistent steps. Focus on understanding the basics, build a strong foundation, then continue exploring without limits."
